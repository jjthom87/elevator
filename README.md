# Node - Event Elevator

<strong>Goal</strong>
Develop a Node.js program that uses event emitters and callbacks to simulate elevator operations.

<strong>Assignment</strong>
* Congrats! You got awarded a contract for designing the elevator software for the new apartment building down the street. Clearly you need to apply your newfound Node.js skills to the test with this job!
* You should create an elevator emitter that can safely move the tenants in this example set of data from the first floor.

<strong>Example Object</strong>
```
var obj = [
	{
		name: "Jared",
		floor: 12
	},
	{
		name: "PJ",
		floor: 3
	}
]
```
